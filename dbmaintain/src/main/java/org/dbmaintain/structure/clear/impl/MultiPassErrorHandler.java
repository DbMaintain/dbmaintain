/**
 * This class is intended to permit multiple attempts (passes) to drop database
 * objects. It helps to solve the problem whereby it is impossible to drop one
 * database object because a dependent object exists (for example when dropping
 * Oracle 11 reference partitioned objects it is necessary to drop all child
 * tables first). </p> This class is used in a <code>do-while</code> loop with
 * the method {@link #continueExecutionAfterPass()} being the loop continuation
 * condition.
 * <pre>
 * do{
 * dropObjects(database);
 * }
 * while ( multiPassErrorHandler.continueExecutionAfterPass() );
 * </pre>
 *
 * In addition whenever an exception occurs it must be recorded with
 * the {@link #addError(RuntimeException)} method.
 *
 * <pre>
 * try {
 * dropObject(objectName);
 * } catch (RuntimeException e) {
 * multiPassErrorHandler.addError(e);
 * }
 * </pre>
