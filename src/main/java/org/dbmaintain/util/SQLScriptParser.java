/**
 * todo javadoc
 * <p/>
 * A class for parsing statements out of sql scripts.
 * <p/>
 * All statements should be separated with a semicolon (;). The last statement will be
 * added even if it does not end with a semicolon. The semicolons will not be included in the returned statements.
 * <p/>
 * All comments in-line (--comment) and block (/ * comment * /) are removed from the statements.
 * This parser also takes quotedOrEmpty literals and double quotedOrEmpty text into account when parsing the statements and treating
 * the comments.
 * <p/>
 * New line charactars within quotes and double quotes will be inclded in the statements, other new lines will
 * be replaced by a single space.
