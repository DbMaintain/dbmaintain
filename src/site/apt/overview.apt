Overview

    DbMaintain enables automatic roll-out of updates to a relational database. It brings database scripts into version control just like regular source code and can be used to transparently deploy databases from development to production. DbMaintain automates the part of the deployment which is most difficult to automate, opening the door for fully automated deployments in all stages of development.
	
	You no longer have to keep track of which database updates have been deployed on which database - DbMaintain does this for you. The database itself keeps track of the scripts that have been applied. A checksum is stored for each script that to ensure nothing has changed to the scripts that were already applied.
	
	Updates are performed incrementally: Only what has been changed since the last deployment is applied. Features such as repeatable scripts, postprocessing scripts, multi-database / database user support and support for patches turn DbMaintain into a complete solution for the enterprise.
	
	DbMaintain integrates seamlessly with {{{http://www.unitils.org}Unitils}}, an open source library for writing automated tests. With unitils you can easily test your application's database integration layer while you develop it, relying on DbMaintain for managing the test database.

** <<2010-08-16 - Release of DbMaintain 2.0>>

    Two new operations have been introduced: markErrorScriptPerformed and markErrorScriptReverted that can be used when a script execution fails.
    See the tutorial for more info on these operations.

    Extra database support was added: PL-SQL parsing for DB2 and MySQL and the possibility to use the native script runners for Oracle (SQL*Plus) and DB2 (db2 CLP).

    A baseline revision concept has been added, giving the possibility to ignore all scripts before this baseline. This could be handy if
    the database starts from an pre-existing image. You then only have to deal with the deltas starting from this version.

    Check the {{{http://jira.unitils.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10010&version=10040}release notes}} for more details.

** <<2010-04-25: Release of DbMaintain 1.1>>

    DbMaintain 1.1 has been released.

Another feature is the possibility to execute scripts native tools such as sqlplus for oracle and clp for db2. The release also includes a number of bug fixes and patches. A complete list of changes can be found in the {{{http://jira.dbmaintain.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10010&styleName=Html&version=10021}release notes}}.
