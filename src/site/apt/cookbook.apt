    This page gets you started with DbMaintain in a few minutes. It demonstrates only a small subset of the features, for a more complete introduction, read the {{{tutorial.html}tutorial}}.
	
	DbMaintain requires that scripts are available that create the database from scratch. These scripts have to be organized in a folder structure, with the sequence of subfolders and scripts indicated by indexes, like in following example:
	
+----+
scripts/01_v1.0/01_products_and_orders.sql
                02_users.sql
		02_v1.1/01_add_barcode_column.sql
		        02_drop_itemcode_column.sql
+----+

    To launch DbMaintain from the command line, you have to create a properties file dbmaintain.properties that configures the location of your scripts and the target database, for example:
	
+-----+
# This property specifies the underlying DBMS implementation. Supported values are 'oracle', 'db2', 'mysql', 'hsqldb' and 'postgresql'.
# The value of this property defines which vendor specific implementations of DbSupport and ConstraintsDisabler are chosen.
database.dialect=hsqldb
database.driverClassName=org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver
database.url=jdbc:hsqldb:mem:testdb
database.userName=sa
database.password=

# Comma-separated list of all database schemas used.
database.schemaNames=PUBLIC
+-----+

    Then execute following command (Replace .sh by .bat if you're using windows)
	
+-----+
/path/to/dbmaintain/dbmaintain.sh update path/to/scriptFolderOrJarFile
+-----+

    To use a different config file than dbmaintain.properties, add the parameter -f followed by the config file name.
	
	To launch DbMaintain using ant, use following ant task:
	
+-----+
<updateDatabase scriptLocations="${database.jarFile}">
     <database userName="admin" password="pwd" url="jdbc:hsqldb:mem:mydb" schemaNames="PUBLIC" dialect="hsqldb" driverClassName="org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver" />
</updateDatabase>
